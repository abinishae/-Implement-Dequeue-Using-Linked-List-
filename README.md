# -Implement-Dequeue-Using-Linked-List-
You are given a dequeue and q queries. The queries can be of 4 types:      ir x: Use insertRear to insert data x in dequeue.     if x: Use insertFront to insert data x in dequeue.     df: Use deleteFront to delete the front of dequeue. If dequeue is empty then don't do anything.     dr: Use deleteRear to delete the rear of dequeue. If dequeue is empty then don't do anything.  Example 1:  Input: q = 4, queries[] = {(ir, 5),      (if, 7), (df), (if, 22)} Output: 22         5 Explanation: Here q = 4. First we insert 5  at the back. Now we insert 7 in the front.  The dequeue is now {7, 5}. Now we remove  the front, so dequeue is now {5}. Now, we  insert 22 in the front. The dequeue is now {22, 5}. So the front is 22 and the rear  is 5.  Example 2:  Input: q = 1, queries[] = {(ir, 8)}  Output: 8 Explanation: Insert 8 in back, so front  and rear elements are same, which is 8.
